Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Naor Cohav, a Computer Science student at Ben-Gurion University (BGU) in my final semester. 
At 25, I'm passionate about both Cybersecurity and Software Development, constantly exploring the intersections between the two fields.

**Projects**
Here are some of the projects you'll find in my repository:

**Trojan Malware**: This project involves the creation of a fake webpage that mimics ChatGPT 5, enticing users to download malware disguised as legitimate software. Once installed, the malware grants me control over the user's command prompt (cmd), demonstrating techniques used in cybersecurity attacks and the importance of user vigilance.

**Sarcasm Detection**: As an AWS project, this endeavor focuses on analyzing Amazon reviews to detect sarcasm. Leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques, the goal is to accurately identify sarcastic comments within the vast pool of product reviews on the platform.

**Scam Firewall [Currently Working]**: In progress, this project aims to develop a firewall solution capable of detecting suspicious activities within an organization's network. Notably, the firewall will dynamically alter packet data to prevent the leakage of sensitive information outside the organization, enhancing cybersecurity measures and safeguarding critical data assets.

Feel free to explore these projects and provide feedback or suggestions!
